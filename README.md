# JavaChess

My implementation of chess in Java. I started the project solely for learning purposes.

Current functionality:
* Dragging pieces with mouse
* Validator making sure that player can't make invalid moves or captures.
* Highlighting available tiles for the piece to move to. Also displays most recent move.
* Detects Check and Checkmate and renders text message on screen
* Player cannot put themselves into check or making normally valid moves when they are checked.
* Standard Algebreic Notation (SAN) rendered during runtime
